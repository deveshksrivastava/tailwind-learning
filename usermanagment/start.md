# User Management System - High Level Design

## Overview
The User Management System (UMS) is a scalable, secure, and efficient system for handling user registration, authentication, authorization, and profile management. The system will support various user roles and permissions, ensuring robust access control. This system will be developed for internal ui 

## Architecture Components

### 1. Client Application
- **Description**: The front-end interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Technologies**: React
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User Interface (UI) for login, registration, and profile management.
  - Interacts with backend services via RESTful APIs in node.
  - State management using Redux for handling user state.

### 2. Backend Services
- **Description**: The server-side logic and database interaction layer.
- **Technologies**: Node.js, Express, Sql Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User authentication and authorization.
  - API endpoints for user CRUD operations.
  - Business logic for handling user roles and permissions.

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- **Description**: Secure user login, session management, and role-based access control.
- **Technologies**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth 2.0
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Token-based authentication for secure access.
  - Middleware for protecting routes based on user roles.
  - Integration with third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

### 4. Database
- **Description**: Persistent storage for user data.
- **Technologies**: Sql Server Database
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Store user information, including credentials, profile details, and roles.
  - Ensure data integrity and security.
  - Provide efficient query capabilities for user-related operations.

### 5. Admin Dashboard
- **Description**: A dedicated interface for system administrators.
- **Technologies**: React
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage user accounts (create, update, delete).
  - Assign and manage user roles and permissions.
  - View system logs and user activity.

## User Roles & Permissions

### 1. Regular User
- **Capabilities**:
  - Register and manage own profile.
  - Authenticate and maintain session.
  - Access resources permitted for general users.

### 2. Admin User
- **Capabilities**:
  - All capabilities of a Regular User.
  - Manage other user accounts.
  - Assign and manage roles and permissions.
  - Access admin-specific resources and dashboards.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticate user and issue JWT.
- **POST /api/auth/logout**: Invalidate user session.
- **POST /api/auth/refresh-token**: Refresh JWT token.

### User Management
- **GET /api/users**: Get list of all users (admin only).
- **GET /api/users/:id**: Get details of a specific user (admin and owner).
- **PUT /api/users/:id**: Update a user's details (admin and owner).
- **DELETE /api/users/:id**: Delete a user (admin only).

### Profile Management
- **GET /api/profile**: Get logged-in user's profile.
- **PUT /api/profile**: Update logged-in user's profile.

## Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.
- **Password Storage**: Use bcrypt for hashing passwords.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add support for MFA for enhanced security.
- **Audit Logs**: Implement detailed audit logs for tracking user activity.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Support multiple languages for a global user base.

## Flow
1. **Azure Ad**: All user are been added to Azuer AD active directory.
2. **Backend**: All User Ad user will be sync with user table from azure.
3. **UI Screen-Mapping**: Each user will be map to user-sytem-role-mapping table.   

## Conclusion
The User Management System is designed to provide a secure and scalable solution for managing user accounts, authentication, and authorization. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices, the system aims to deliver a robust user experience while ensuring security and performance.
